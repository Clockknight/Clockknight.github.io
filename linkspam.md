### Brandon Sanderson Audiobook torrents Google Drive Folder
Torrents with mp3s of Graphic Audio, a very high quality audiobook company. If you're not familiar with torrenting, let me know. I've torrented these myself and made sure that they dont have anything malicious.

### 40k on TableTop Simulator Discord
Find a faction, build an army, and meet other Spokanites to play 40k online. Playing on TTS is much cheaper than playing physical - only cost is buying TTS itself.

### My Fighting Game's Discord
Currently programming a fighting game - if you're interested in helping with any aspect- visual or coding or anything else, feel free to join and lend a hand. 

I send updates in the #updates channel on the discord, but as of writing this (3/19), I'm currently in a pre-pre-alpha stage of development, working on the bare minimums in order to create a fighting game. I have some documentation down for character description and game ideas, but nothing in there is set in stone.
