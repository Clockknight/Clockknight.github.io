## Google Drive full of Brandon Sanderson Audiobook torrents
Torrents with mp3s of Graphic Audio, a very high quality audiobook company. If you're not familiar with torrenting, let me know. I've torrented these myself and made sure that they dont have anything malicious.

Find a faction, build an army, and meet other Spokanites to play 40k online. Playing on TTS is much cheaper than playing physical - only cost is buying TTS itself.
