[DAILY COUNTDOWN TIMER]()
Daily Countdown Timer is intended to specifically work with the Rainmeter extension "Magnumizer's Countdown Timer", that will update the date to today, leaving the time untouched.
This program will prompt for a location of the timer settings, if it doesn't already have a location saved. It'll save it by putting it to a .txt file in the same directory as the script.

[FILE RAISER]()
<details>
<summary>File Raiser will scan a given directory for any subdirectories, and any files inside of those subdirectories, moving them up to the initial directory.</summary>
