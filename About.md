Hello! This is my site, I enjoy gathering resources here to share with friends or professional associates.

In terms of professional work, I enjoy problem-solving, whether through working on code, or in a broader sense of resolving issues others are having.

Most of my experience has been in Python, working in various projects to try an dautomate things that I noticed I was doing myself multiple times a day, but recently has come to focus more on Game Development.

I have a few hobbies that I would love to pursue, either leading and working on them professionally, or as a hobby, as something to enjoy with friends.
- Game Development.
  - As seen on the main page, I've done work on game jams, and working on a pet project fighting game. Video games have been a pretty central part of my social life, and I'd be very happy to contribute something to them someday.
  - Additionally, I play Dungeons & Dragons, and I'm currently working on a homebrew of my own, based on the campaigns I've run with friends in the past.
- Magic: The Gathering. As a longstanding blue player, I've always enjoyed being a rules lawyer as well as trying to find unique interactions, no matter how slow.
- Miniature Painting. Part of the appeal is a painted model to play with in games of Warhammer 40k, or for Dungeons & Dragons, but there is also the satisfaction of assembling a model and coloring it to both match the hierarchies of the faction, as well as whatever colors look pleasing.
