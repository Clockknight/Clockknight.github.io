## Resource: Faithful Interventions

During the Preparation Phase, the Cleric may spend their Interventions to roll the respective amount of Faith Dice.

The results are stored until the Cleric's next Preparation Phase, and can be used any time based on the Action's Keywords. 

The Cleric has 9 Interventions, and can spend any amount of Hit Dice during a Short rest to replenish one Intervention per Dice spent.

The Cleric may choose a prayer for the turn based on the results of the dice.

"dx" represents the current value of the Intervention Dice, decided based on the Empower Intervention Dice. 

1 Intervention - 1dx

2 Interventions - 2dx

3 Interventions - 3dx

## Prayers:

Each Prayer has conditions. If you do not meet any of these conditions, you refund all except one Die, and heal all characters of your choosing by the highest value rolled. 

###  Call for Aid:

#### Requirement: 2 or more Intervention Dice.

_Slow_ Expend all remaining dice. Add up the total. Heal all Unobstructed targets you choose for that value.

3+: _Quick_ Target uses one Hit Dice as if they took a Short Rest.

6+: _Slow_ Heal melee targets you choose for twice the amount of your level.

9+: _Quick_ Target declares an additional Attack or Spell.

***

### Solicit Vengeance

#### Requirement: At least one Intervention Die is 6 or higher 

3+: _Reactive_ Select an Unobstructed target that just Hit a second target. The second target immediately Attacks the first Target.

6+: _Quick_ Challenge any amount of Unobstructed targets' Charisma within 30ft. Goad all who fail.  

8+: _Lingering_ When you are Hit, immediately Attack them. Use Charisma for Hit and Damage bonuses, and use an Intervention Die for damage.

***

### Assuring Mantra

#### Requirement: Intervention Dice add up to at least 12.

In this prayer, all dice results are pooled. Add up all of the rolled dice results, and keep track of them as Assurance Points until the next Preparation Phase.

_Lingering_ Your AC is increased by the amount of Assurance Points remaining.

_Reactive_ If a character would be hit, instead it is not. Only possible if the difference between the Hit Roll and the target's AC is less than the remaining Assurance Points. Reduce the amount remaining by this number.

4 Assurance Points: _Quick_ Challenge a melee target's Charisma. If you win, Goad the target.

8 Assurance Points: _Quick_ Challenge a melee target's Dexterity. If you win, Stun the target.
