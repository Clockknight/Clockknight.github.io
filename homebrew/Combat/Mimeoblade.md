# Mimeoblade

This subclass of the Legion focuses on map control, by either threatening multiple areas at once, or utilizing their kit for very high mobility.

Using Echo Knight as a base, and then changing it to keep the dice pool themes going.

<ul>
<li>
Manifest Echo has been changed so that it can only be created at your current space. It can still move as normal, and receives an extra 15 feet of movement when it is spawned. Additionally, it can only move through things you could.

<li>
Remove in Echo Fighter: Unleash Incarnation. By threatening an additional amount of area, an unconditional extra attack seems overkill on top of Action Surge. However, your Echos can still take attacks of opportunity.

## Resource: Phantom Arm

During the Preparation Phase, the Mimeoblade may spend up to one of their Phantom Arms to roll the appropriate amount of dice, or that amount plus two if they spend two. 

The results are stored until the Mimeoblade's next Preparation Phase, and can be used any time based on the Action's Keywords. 

The Mimeoblade has 5 Phantom Arms, and can spend any amount of Hit Dice during a Short rest to replenish one Phantom Arm per Dice spent.

## Phantom Arms

The requirements are for differences between dice. e.g.: 4- would be acceptable with any combination of 1 & 1, 2 & 4, 1 & 5, but not 1 & 6. 

4-: _Instantaneous_ Make one ranged attack from a target that would be valid to one of your Echoes. This attack still suffers the regular penalties for ranged attacks if the Echo is threatened.

1-: _Quick_ For each Echo, choose one target in melee range of it. Roll an attack with your current Melee weapon. If there is not one, roll as if you are using an improvised weapon. Roll as if you hit. Apply the results to each target selected. 

0: _Instantaneous_ _Concentration_ Manifest another Echo. You may only have a number of Echoes equal to the amount of Phantom Arm Dice available to you. Move it immediately, with the bonus 15 feet. Each Echo accounts for one stack of concentration. 

_Reactive_ Spend a die. Add its total to any given d20 result.

### Out of combat

Outside of combat, you may also spend one Phantom Arm to Manifest the maximum amount of Echoes. These Echoes disappear when combat begin.
