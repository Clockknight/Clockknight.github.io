## Resource: Keen Combat

During combat, if an attack is made with a weapon type that you have not attempted yet this turn, you receive a stack of Keenness.

Each stack of Keenness adds 1 to your Hit and Damage modifiers.

Keenness caps at your levels in Ranger.

Keenness goes away after 10 minutes of non-combat.

Keenness can be spent during the Preparation Phase:

4: _Quick_ Declare another attack.

3: _Slow_ Declare two attacks. If the target(s) attempt to move, the Hit rolls will be made at disadvantage.


## Resource: Honed Instincts

During the Preparation Phase, the Ranger may spend any of their Honed Instincts to roll that many d8.

The results are stored until the Ranger's next Preparation Phase, and can be used any time based on the Action's Keywords. 

The Ranger can spend any amount of Hit Dice during a Short rest to replenish one Honed Instinct per Dice spent.
