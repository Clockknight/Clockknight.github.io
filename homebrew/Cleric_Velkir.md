## Resource: Faithful Interventions

During the Preparation Phase, the Cleric may spend their Interventions to roll the respective amount of Faith Dice.

The results are stored until the Cleric's next Preparation Phase, and can be used any time based on the Action's Keywords. 

The Cleric has 9 Interventions, and can spend any amount of Hit Dice during a Short rest to replenish one Intervention per Dice spent.

The Cleric may choose a prayer for the turn based on the results of the dice.

"dx" represents the current value of the Intervention Dice, decided based on the Empower Intervention Dice. 

1 Intervention - 1dx

2 Interventions - 2dx

3 Interventions - 3dx
