## Resource: Phytoblossoms

During the Preparation Phase, the Druid may spend any number of Phytoblossoms to roll 1d10 per Phytoblossom spent. They then choose a number of Groves to be available for selection, after seeing the results.

When rolling dice, keep track of the total results. This sum is referred to as your Phytoharvest.

The results are stored until the Druid's next Preparation Phase, and can be used any time based on the Action's Keywords.

The amount of Phytoblossoms the druid has is equivalent to their Druid levels. 

The Druid can spend any amount of Hit Dice during a Short rest to replenish one Phytoblossom per Dice spent.

This can be done during Wild Shape or outside of it.

## Groves

_Focus_ For each Phytoblossom you spent, you may burn that dice. If you do, choose a tile you can see within 60ft. Each Grove grows onto all tiles one could conceivably walk onto without jumping within it's range. 

By default, the range of a Grove is 5ft.

Each Grove has a Leafheart in the centered space you chose. It does not take space. It has HP equal to your Phytoharvest. The AC is 10, and the movement is 0.

If a Grove would grow onto a space already occupied by another Grove, then the newest Grove's rules take priority.

All Groves have:

_Instantaneous_ Burn a dice. This Grove's range is increased by 5ft.

## Savior's Trunks

_Quick_ Once per turn, any targets inside this heal for 1/2 of xd4, where x is 1/2 of your remaining Phytoblossoms (minimum 1).

_Reactive_ If an attack would hit a target, you may add your dice's roll to that target's AC, or DR.

## Choking Brambles

_Slow_ Once per turn, Any targets inside this grove make a Dex or Str Saving throw. The DC is 10 + your remaining Phytoblossoms. If the target fails the save, their movement is set to 0 on their next turn.

## Prickley Thickets

_Lingering_ Any targets moving in or ending their turn in this Grove receive 1/2 of xd4 Piercing damage, where x is 1/2 of your remaining Phytoblossoms (minimum 1).

### Out of combat

Outside of combat, you may also spend one Phytoblossom to temporarily change the biome of a 100 ft circle around you into the one related to the Circle you've chosen.
